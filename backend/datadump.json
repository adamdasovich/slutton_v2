    "explanation": "Both terms are correct! Freud's Oedipus Complex describes a boy's attachment to his mother, while Carl Jung later coined the Electra Complex for a girl's attachment to her father. While modern psychology largely dismisses these theories, they remain influential in understanding childhood development and adult relationships.",

The \"GrÃ¤fenberg spot\" (later shortened to G-spot) became widely known in the 1980s. However, its existence remains debated in medical circles, with some researchers suggesting it's part of the clitoral complex.",
